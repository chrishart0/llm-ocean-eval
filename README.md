# LLM OCEAN (Big Five) Personality Evaluation

## Overview

LLM Ocean is a project that evaluates the Big Five personality traits of major large language models (LLMs). The aim is to assess base personality profiles using a standardized test via API and share the results publicly. This sets a foundation for understanding LLM behavioral tendencies, with potential for later expansion (e.g., testing trait flexibility).
